## Hello MDX World!

This is our first post using the new MDX file format. We're excited about this change as it offers more flexibility and a better developer experience for managing our blog content.

### Why MDX?

MDX allows us to write JSX embedded in Markdown. This means we can:
- Use React components directly within our blog posts.
- Write content in familiar Markdown syntax.
- Keep content separate from our application logic.

### Key Features of this Post

*   **Frontmatter**: Check out the metadata at the top of this file!
*   **Markdown**: Standard Markdown formatting works as expected.
*   **Custom Styles**: Thanks to `@tailwindcss/typography`, this content should be nicely styled.

We hope you enjoy our new blogging platform. Stay tuned for more updates!

Here's a list:
1.  Item one
2.  Item two
3.  Item three

> This is a blockquote. Isn't it cool?

And some `inline code`.

```javascript
// A code block
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```
